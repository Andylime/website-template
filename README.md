# New Project template
--------

This is a template to just simply make you up and running. It supports:
* jade files
* stylus files
* coffee files

Also you should be aware of that this template will install the latest version of jquery, bootstrap, modernizr, and normalize.css as soon as you run the "bower i" command in your terminal. To modify that, just edit bower.json file. Note that jquery isn't present due to it comes bundled with bootstrap already.

To get you started, just choose the folder you want the website to be in, and execure
```
git clone https://github.com/Andylime/website-template.git && cd website-template && npm i && bower i && gulp
```

Well, I know this template isn't perfect, it just can't be. But I wrote it to make `my` life easier. So, if you find it helpful, feel free to use it in your projects.

That's it. Thanks for reading.
